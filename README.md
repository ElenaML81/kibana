# kibana
Visualization of datasets using Elasticsearch / kibana

## Explanation of this exercise

This exercise consists of performing visualizations of a dataset using Elasticsearch / kibana. 

To perform the exercise I have registered in the online resource of the https://www.elastic.co page which allows a free trial for 14 days. 

This page contains some test datasets that we have used to perform exercises 1 and 3. Exercise 2 has been performed using a dataset downloaded from kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gregorut/videogamesales.  Before using the dataset in kibana we have removed some rows that contained null values.
